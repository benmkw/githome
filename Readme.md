This is a simple tool which opens the (github) page of a cloned git repository by searching the file hierarchy upwards for a git repository.
It only works on macOS.

Its basically the same as `open (git config --get remote.origin.url)` but it tries to handle ssh remotes as well as https ones.

I use it all them time and think you might like it or create something similar adapted to your needs.
